## Intro

DeepThought Engine is an experimental Unreal Engine plugin designed to facilitate the integration and use of various machine learning model architectures. 
Inspired by HuggingFace Transformers' relationship with PyTorch, DeepThought Engine aims to support a diverse range of models beyond just Transformers.

Our goal is to make advanced machine-learning capabilities accessible directly within Unreal Engine through C++ and Blueprints, empowering game developers to innovate with cutting-edge AI techniques.

We need volunteers to help this project come to fruition. Every contribution is valuable and helps us achieve our mission.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork and Clone:** Start by [forking the repo](https://github.com/P1ayer-1/DeepThought-Engine/fork) and [cloning your fork locally](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
2. **Find an Issue:** Look for [open issues](https://github.com/P1ayer-1/DeepThought-Engine/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen) that interest you or [open a new one](https://github.com/P1ayer-1/DeepThought-Engine/issues/new).
3. **Make Your Changes:** Work on the issue in your local environment.
4. **Submit a Pull Request:** Push your changes to your fork and [open a pull request](https://github.com/P1ayer-1/DeepThought-Engine/compare) against our repository.




### Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to DeepThought Engine](https://github.com/P1ayer-1/DeepThought-Engine/compare) with a clear list of what you've done. 
Make sure to follow our coding conventions and ensure all your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. Optionally, you can include background information and rationale for your changes.

An example of background information is: `A description of a conversation you had on the Discord server that inspired you to create the feature.`

An example of rationale: This PR provides `A foundation for integrating speculative decoding.`


One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:


```shell
git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
>
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact.
>
> A paragraph describing relevant background information and/or why you are opening the Pull Request (If applicable)."
```

### Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you may be able to get the hang of it. 
If you're unsure, feel free to contact me (@p1ayer_1) on [Discord](https://discord.gg/AWWECeRcyX) or open an issue for discussion 
Here are some key points to keep in mind:

  * **Indentation:** We indent using four spaces (standard tabs)
  * **Code Style:** Follow [Unreal Engine's coding standards](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/epic-cplusplus-coding-standard-for-unreal-engine)
  * **Separation of Concerns:** Keep logic out of views as much as possible; utilize Unreal Engine's helper functions.
  * **Working with others:** This is open-source software. You should remember that other people will read your code, and try to make it look nice for them.
